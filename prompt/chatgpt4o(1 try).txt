Analyze the following JSON data extracted from a VSDX file, representing a process flow diagram. Determine the logical order of the diagram based on the spatial relationships of shapes, including their positions (X, Y coordinates), shape types, and structural connections, rather than relying solely on explicitly defined links. Identify points where the flow diverges, converges, or requires validation, and infer their role within the diagram. When missing connectors are detected, use positioning logic to infer the most probable flow sequence. Generate a structured, numbered step-by-step process that accurately describes the workflow. Ensure that actions are naturally incorporated into the description by integrating the textual content of each shape while maintaining contextual accuracy. Maintain clear differentiation between distinct process paths and actions that adjust or validate system states. The final release step should be identified and positioned as the conclusion of the structured sequence, following the inferred workflow based on the available diagram structure.
